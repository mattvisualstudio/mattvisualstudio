# 👋 Hi there, I'm Matt!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a developer who enjoys building efficient, clean, and modern solutions. Except I'm none of those and I seg fault every other test.

- ⚙️ Automating Windows builds and scripting environments

## 🛠️ Technologies I work with
- **Languages**: C++, C, Python, JavaScript, Bash
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, VS Code, Windows Terminal, Git
- **Platforms**: Windows 11, WSL2, Linux, PowerShell

## 🔩 UNIX

- **Neovim**: I used to use neovim with my own config

- **Compiler**: Clang. Just better imo.
- **Distro**: Arch 😔 Was on Gentoo but most coding was low-level C to actually fix my OS.
